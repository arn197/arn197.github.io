1. **Variable Quantized Ensemble Networks**
	
	* Developed a system geared towards real-time semantic segmentation through variable quantization of ensembles of neural networks, trained on pre-determined groups of classes of Cityscapes Dataset and Indian Driving Dataset
	* Applied proposed method to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models PSPNet and Deeplab-v3+, showing a 10% accuracy trade-off for large improvements in inference time and almost 20% reduction in memory usage
	* Developed using PyTorch and Tensorflow in Python

2. **Distributed TicTacToe and chat room**
	
	* Developed a distributed TicTacToe game, in a client-server setup using the Java RMI protocol
	* Parallelized the game server to handle multiple games, along with a chat server for multiple clients/client groups

3. **AngelSafe**
	
	* Designed and implemented a website focused on promoting safety of women during travel by making use of crowdsourced data to generate heat maps representing threat levels in a particular area
	* Secured first place in the Code.Fun.Do hackathon online round organized by Microsoft India in Hyderabad
	* Built using the MEAN Stack, consisting of MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js and Angular.js

4. **Music Genre Classification**
	
	* This project involved analysis of songs and predicting the genre using Neural Networks, SVM's, KNN's and Random Forests.
	* Performed analysis of songs and built feature sets using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) of each track.
	* Implementation was done using Python, Keras and scikit-learn.
	* Neural Network approach gave better overall accuracy than the results published in the paper this project was based on.

5. **Seeing the Arrow of Time**
	
	* A project of the Computer Vision course to implement a paper titled Seeing the Arrow of Time which was submitted to CVPR in 2014, with the aim of being able to predict the direction of flow of time in a video.
	* Method was based on analyzing patterns of motion for temporal asymmetries, captured using a SIFT-like descriptor.
	* Implemented using Python and Numpy

6. **Mini SQL Engine**
	
	* Built an SQL engine in Python to parse and execute SQL commands, with relevant error handling

7. **Model Compression Project in collaboration with Microsoft Research India**
	
	* Involved compression of models(for video and image analysis related tasks), exporting them to mobile and testing performance, accuracy and hardware load
	* Built an Android app using Tensorflow Lite to run compressed models for detecting and processing actions and facial expressions of drivers while driving.

8. **Privacy in Online Social Media**
	
	* Course project with the aim of displaying the power that is possessed by social media companies, in the form of predictive analysis, with applications in targeted advertisements and a lot more.
	* Data of consenting participants was collected using publicly available API's and Selenium
	* Analysis of data was done to generate statistics like daily active hours, frequently referenced topics, frequently used keywords, emotions in speech, closest friends and so on.

9. **Game Development**
	
	* Designed and developed a game in Unity3D, incorporating particle effects, projectile physics and collider mechanics
	* Developed variations of the popular games BrickBreaker and Bloxorz in 2D and 3D respectively using OpenGL
	* Developed an Aquarium model using WebGL
